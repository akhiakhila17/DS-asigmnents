join queries:

inner join (it provides common values from both the tables)
select * from student inner join  student1 on student.stu_name=student1.stu_name;

left join(can see all values from the left table and only the matching values from the right table)
select * from student left join student1 on student.stu_name=student1.stu_name;

right join(opposite to left join quries)
select * from student right join student1 on student.stu_name=student1.stu_name;

full join(can see all values from both the tables)
select * from student full join student1 on student.stu_name=student1.stu_name;

Queries related to Union and Intersect
