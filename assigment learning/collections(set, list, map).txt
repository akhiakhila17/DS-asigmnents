1,    collections using List, Set,TreeMap

1)list-> maintain insertion order 
         3 types
         ArrayList-> maintain order and based on index((travers of list)if the list in fixed ther will be no updates means use arraylist)not present
         LinkedList-> if there are any updates or changes use LinkedList(frequent updates)not preset
         vector->multiple threads accesing the list use vector, maintain insertion order and provide present, it acces only one thread at a time , in case of                  multi threading environment


2)set-> it does not bother about order it removes the duplicates
         3 types
        Hash Set->provides it removes the duplicates, and doesnot maintain order by default
                  allows only one null values
                  whatever the elements you add hashset simply ignores it (even duplicates)
 

        linked Hashset-> doesnot allows duplicates, but maintain order
        TreeSet-> doent allow dup, but provide sorted order or decesing order.


3) Map-> by default provide key value piar relation based on index(indexing:when you pass some key automatically you get value)
             2 implementations
        HashMap->provides key to value pair relationship , allow 1 null key and multiple null values,and it is not thread safe.
        HashTable->provides key to value pair relationship , doesnot null key values,and it is thread safe.
